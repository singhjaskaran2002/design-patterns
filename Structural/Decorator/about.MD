## Decorator
_Decorator_ is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

##### Decorator vs Adapter ?
- **Decorator**, attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. For example adding sugar in a coffee.
- **Adapter**, adapts interface of an existing class to another interface. For example eletrical adapter.

##### Where to use ?
- When you want to transparently and dynamically add responsibilities to objects without affecting other objects.
- When you want to add responsibilities to an object that you may want to change in future.
- Extending functionality by sub-classing is no longer practical.

##### Some real-world examples are:
1) Decorating a Christmas tree.
2) Adding toppings to pizza.
3) Clothes on a human body.
4) Interior decoration of a building.
