## Decorator
_Decorator_ is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

##### Decorator vs Adapter
- **Decorator**, attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. For example adding sugar in a coffee.
- **Adapter**, adapts interface of an existing class to another interface. For example eletrical adapter.
