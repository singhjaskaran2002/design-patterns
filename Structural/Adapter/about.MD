## Adpater Pattern

The _Adapter Pattern_ is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

##### The Adapter design pattern solves these problems:

1) How can a class be reused that does not have an interface that a client requires?
2) How can classes that have incompatible interfaces work together?
3) How can an alternative interface be provided for a class?
