## Facade 
The Facade pattern is a design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, reducing the amount of code required to interact with it and shielding the client code from the complexity of the subsystem.

##### You might consider using the Facade pattern in the following situations:

- When working with a complex library or framework that has a large number of classes and methods, and you only need to use a subset of them.
- When dealing with legacy code that has a complex or poorly-designed interface, and you want to create a simpler and more intuitive interface for the client code.
- When you want to decouple the client code from the implementation details of the subsystem, making it easier to change or replace the subsystem in the future.
- When you want to reduce the amount of code required to interact with the subsystem, making the client code simpler and easier to understand.
