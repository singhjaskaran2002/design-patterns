## What are Design Patterns ?

##### There are various definitions for it. Letâ€™s have a look at them:
- Design patterns are a fundamental part of software development, as they provide typical solutions to commonly recurring problems in software design. Rather than providing specific pieces of software, design patterns are merely concepts that can be used to handle recurring themes in an optimized way.

- Design patterns are common architectural patterns.

- Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

##### Algorithm vs Design pattern: 
Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

##### Types
1) ###### Creational
    - Singleton
    - Prototype
    - Factory
    - Builder

2) ###### Structural
    - Adapter
    - Facade
    - Proxy
    - Decorator
    - Bridge
3) ###### Behavioural
    - Iterator
    - Observer
    - Mediator
    - State

##### Conclusion
Design patterns are essential tools for software developers to create well-structured, scalable, and maintainable code. By following these patterns, developers can create more efficient, modular, and reusable code that can be easily adapted to changing requirements.
